# Computer Vision Expert
My journey began at the age of 14 when I first started learning how to program. I have always been attracted to the 
visually appealing: graphics, 3D, and video games, but more than anything I wanted to understand how do they work.
Luckily both of my parents are engineers so with their help, before I finished high-school I was already creating my own games.
After high-school I started my B.Sc in Computer Engineering at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology as part of the IDF's
academic program. In the Technion I experienced a wide variety of different fields, my favorite were Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
I realized that in the spatially related fields I had a sharp intuition that helped me solve those problems at ease.

After my B.Sc I joined the IDF. I was an officer working on research and development in GIS and Computer Vision for 4 years.
In the IDF I learned how to work with people in high stress environments with short deadlines, and to think outside the box.
I started my M.Sc in Computer Science in the Open University of Israel while serving in the IDF,
with focus on Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.
Immediately after I was released from the IDF, I co-founded my Start-Up with two other partners. We developed a technology for
Augmented Reality that does tracking and mapping of the world with a single RGB camera, merging both of my favorite fields: 
Computer Vision and Computer Graphics.

Now I am working on a research project, together with professors and students from the USC, for about a year and a half.
I learned a lot while working on the project, especially in the field of Machine Learning and Deep Neural Networks.
Most importantly I became more open to give back to the open source community that I relied on so much. I now have
several open source libraries on [GitHub](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin), and a pending [OpenCV contribution](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/opencv_contrib/tree/DenseSIFT).

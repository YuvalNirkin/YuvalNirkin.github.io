What happens to machine face recognition when you perform state-of-the-art face swapping?
We show how we achieve state-of-the-art face swapping and face segmentation under unprecedented conditions using simple methods.
Unlike previous work, our swapping is robust enough to allow for extensive quantitative tests.

This project provides a utility for monocular camera calibration from camera feeds, videos and image sequences,
using 3 different camera models. The calibration process is completely automatic.
The user is only required to capture a board with square patterns using spherical movements around it.

Code has been made available at: [https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/camera_calibration](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/camera_calibration)
